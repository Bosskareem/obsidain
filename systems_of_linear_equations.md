 **linear equation form**

 the set of all possible solutions is called a **solution set** fo the linear system.Two linear system are called **equivalent** if they have the same solution set.That is each solution of the first system is a solution of the second system..والعكس

 of course,two lines need not interesect in a single point--they could be parallel,or the could by coincide and hence intersect at every point.

 A system of linear equations has 
 1. no solution ..or 
 2. exactly one solution ..or 
 3. infinitely many solutions
 ****
 A system of linear equations is said to be**consistent** if if has either one solution or infinitely many solutions 
 a system is **inconsistent** if it has no solution

 ### solving a linear system
 the basic strategy is to replace one system with an equivalent system(.i.e oen with the same solution set) that is easier to solve.
 :roughly speaking,use the x1 term in the first equation  of a system to eliminate the x1 term in the other equations...and so on unitl you finally obtain a very simple equivalent system of equations.

 #### Three basic operations are used(ElEmetnry row operatoins)
 1. **replace** one equation  by the sum of itself and a multiple of another equation
 2. **interchange** the two equations
 3. **multiply**(sacling) all the terms in an equation by a nonzero constant
 ****
 Two matrices are called **row equivalent**if there is a sequence of elementray row operations that transforms one matrix into the other.
 *it is important to note that the row operations are **revesible***
 ****
 Since the original system can be produced via row operations on the new system,each solution of the new system is also a solution of the original system 
:if the augmented matrices of two linear systems are row equivalent,then the two systems have the same solution set

#  Existence and uniqueness questions
To determine which possibility is true for a particular system,we ask two questions
1. is the system consistent;that is does at least one soultion exsit?
2. if a solution exists, is it the only one ?;;that is ,is the solution unique?
