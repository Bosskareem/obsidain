1. how did leontief  write his model in economics and divide the the 500 equations and 500 unkonws into a system of 42 equtations and 42 unkonws?
# you should master numpy in datacamp and learn how to do all linear algebra operations with it
2. how to use partitioned matrices in data science and in your work.
3. you should solve all the important problems in this book in python 
4. study the section related to leontief input-output model well...and try to apply it in the exercises and in real life problems
5. two coordinate systems for the same vector space...can you apply that in data scinece???
6. where you can find discrete time singals in big data and data analysis or machine learning patterns...???
7. can you write an algorthim to solve the characteristic equation for general n * n matrix for n>= 5.

8. how to apply complex linear algebra in real life application?....such problems like real dynamical systems that involve periodic motion,vibration,or some type of rotation in space??..can complex linear algebra add to linear transformation and Computer vision....????or can it give you a more clear picture??...can you reuse the complex linear algebra in all application that require it in datascice..like ..caculate the pca..or find the eigenvalues for complex charactersitc equation.??

10. relation between Jacobina matrix and the attractors and repellers in machine learning ...???
11.  Symmetric matrices arise more often in applications,in one way or another,than any other class of matrices.The theory  is rich and beautiful,depending in an essential way on both diagonalization from chapter 5 and orthogonality form chapter 6.???read it again fine...?
12.  Geometry in higher dimesnsions ...and it's applications for data visualizations and data analysis or machine learning......?
